   <h2>keeping it real</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><b>honesty is key:</b> share your genuine thoughts and experiences.  this is a safe space for unfiltered, constructive feedback.</li>
    <li><b>respect the anonymity:</b>  never try to identify yourself or anyone else.  the power of in-house comes from the freedom to speak without fear.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>keeping it clean</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><b>no personal attacks:</b> focus on issues, not individuals.  criticize ideas, not people.</li>
    <li><b>no hate speech or discrimination:</b>  in-house is a place for everyone.  bigotry of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
    <li><b>no harassment or bullying:</b>  treat everyone with respect, even when you disagree.</li>
    <li><b>keep it professional:</b> avoid overly casual or unprofessional language.  while honesty is encouraged, maintain a respectful tone.</li>
    <li><b>no spam or self-promotion:</b>  in-house is not a platform for advertising. focus on workplace discussions and feedback.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>keeping it constructive</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><b>focus on solutions:</b>  while identifying problems is important, try to offer potential solutions or suggestions for improvement.</li>
    <li><b>be specific:</b> vague complaints are less helpful.  provide concrete examples and details to support your feedback.</li>
